# k3s cluster

This example will deploy:

* one Oracle compute instance, k3s-server
* one instance configuration used by the instance pool
* one instance pool
* three Oracle compute instances launched by the instance pool, k3s-agents
* one network load balancer, that will route the traffic from the internet to our instance pool instances

The network load balancer is made by:

* two listener (port 80, and 443)
* two backed set, one for the http listener and one for the https listener
* one backed for each of the instances in the instance pool

The traffic is routed from the internet to the traefik ingress controller.

### Extra variables

In this example an extra variable is used:

* k3s_nodes list of objects with properties:
 - name = Name of instance
 - shape  = Shape of instance
 - image_id =  Id of image
 - k3s_role = "server" or "agent"
 - ocpus =  number of ocpus
 - memory = available memory
 - private_ip = private_ip of instance
 - boot_volume_size_in_gbs = Boot volume size (min 50GiB
 By default this is configured to use all available memory and ocpus. 2 Arm and 2 Amd instances.


* k3s_server_private_ip, private ip address that will be associated to the k3s-server
* fault_domains, this variable is a list of fault domains where our instance pool will deploy our instances
* k3s_token, token used to install the k3s cluster. Should match regex [a-z0-9]{29}-[a-z0-9]{22}
* install_longhorn, boolean value, if true (default) will install [longhorn](https://longhorn.io/) block storage 
* longhorn_release, longorn release version

**Remember** to set the provider [settings](https://github.com/garutilorenzo/oracle-cloud-terraform-examples#oracle-provider-setup) and ajust all the [variables](https://github.com/garutilorenzo/oracle-cloud-terraform-examples#other-variables-to-adjust)

### Deploy

To deploy the infrastructure:

```
terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
```

wait terraform to complete the operation, when terraform successfully finished the deployment you will see in the output the public ip addresses of the k3s-server instance, the public ip addresses of the k3s-agents instances and the public ip address of the network load balancer:

```
Apply complete! Resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

k3s_server_ip = "152.x.x.x"
k3s_agents_ips = [
  "152.x.x.x",
  "152.x.x.x",
  "152.x.x.x",
]
lb_ip = tolist([
  {
    "ip_address" = "133.x.x.x"
    "is_public" = true
    "reserved_ip" = tolist([])
  },
])
```

now you can ssh into the k3s-server machine:

```
ssh ubuntu@152.x.x.x

...
35 updates can be applied immediately.
25 of these updates are standard security updates.
To see these additional updates run: apt list --upgradable

ubuntu@k3s-server:~$
```

Test the connection to the load balancer:

```
curl -v http://132.x.x.x/
*   Trying 132.x.x.x:80...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 132.x.x.x (132.x.x.x) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 132.x.x.x
> User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
< Date: Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:20:05 GMT
< Content-Length: 19
< 
404 page not found
* Connection #0 to host 132.x.x.x left intact
```

**NOTE** You have to wait all the backends to be in HEALTH state before reaching successfully the load balancer.

**NOTE 2** 404 is a correct response since there are no deployment yet

### Cluster management

To manage the cluster, open a ssh connection to the k3s-server.

**List the nodes**

```
root@k3s-server:~# kubectl get nodes
NAME                    STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
inst-vr4sv-k3s-agents   Ready    <none>                 23m   v1.21.5+k3s2
inst-zkcyl-k3s-agents   Ready    <none>                 23m   v1.21.5+k3s2
k3s-server              Ready    control-plane,master   23m   v1.21.5+k3s2
inst-fhayc-k3s-agents   Ready    <none>                 23m   v1.21.5+k3s2
```

**Get the pods running on kube-system namespace**

```
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
